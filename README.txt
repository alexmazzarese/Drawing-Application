For this assignment we were supposed to implement a fully functional "Paint App" that works similar to the one we know on microsoft operating systems. For this assignment I would say that I completed about 85% of the required features. All of the shape implementations work exactly as intended, except for the polyline which sometimes doesn't connect fully to the last line. Furthermore, I implemented all of the transformations, undo and save image files. But I was unable to implement a working "Read JSON From File" function. Finally, the select feature did not end up working either, so the copy and paste features also do not work. However, I implemented this entire application using no external API libraries so I believe I got the major load of the work done using simply just HTML, CSS and Javascript. However, as far as extra features implemented, I added: a redo feature and a color change feature. All of the files necessary to operate the application can be found within the "Chap9" directory.


UPDATE (5/2/21:

	- Added the pentagon, heptagon and octagon shapes
	- Fixed the user interface so the website is easier to navigate
